### How to run Linux Mint for Beginners
# Tools required:
1. A computer
2. Flash drive (minimum 4gb, 8gb recommended) (This will be used to create the Portable Linux installation media)
## Steps:
1. [Open the official linux mint website](https://linuxmint.com/download.php)
2. Download the suitable OS matching your system requirements. (If your PC is relatively new, you should go with the Cinnamon Edition. If it is a relatively older machine, go for the Xfce Edition.)

5. Plug in your Flash Drive and select it as a target.
6. Flash!
7. After the installation media is created, restart your PC and enter the BIOS. (The key to enter BIOS is usually one of the function keys. You can search your BIOS key by entering your motherboard model or if you're using a laptop, the model of the laptop)
8. Set the boot priority of the flash drive to the highest.
